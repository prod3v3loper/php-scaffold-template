# PHP MVC Advanced

Model View Controller for Advanced users to bring the way closer.

This MVC has a good structure, but you still have to implement the validation yourself in the controller. 
However, one can also automate the validation since we represent a database table with each of our models and we can also write a validation. 

But more about it in the PHP MVC Professional can find here in the near future.

# Attention

This one should not use in a real environment but unfortunately there is also something in real environments.
