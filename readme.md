Most use grunt, Webpack and then Yeoman as an example to create a scaffolding, but you can do that with all Languages here with PHP.

You can also Scaffolden with Grunt and Webpack PHP projects and vice versa too. In addition, here comes more later on my repos.

This repo here is a prepared template from [PHP MVC Advanced](https://github.com/prod3v3loper/php-mvc-advanced), you can either clone it in a folder of your choice.

# Get Template

If we have this, almost everything is done, we just have to clone the templates here, so download so we can use them.

`/path/what/you/want/`
```
git clone https://github.com/prod3v3loper/php-scaffold-template.git /path/what/you/want/php-scaffold-templates
```

# Use Template

Switch to the projects folder.
```
username$ cd /Users/username/projects/
```

Now we can add our template to our project by executing the following command.

`/path/what/you/want/`
```
projects$ php /path/what/you/want/php-scaffold-templates/php-scaffold-template/index.php
```

When we start then we get asked with which we can still adjust our project. If all questions are answered they will be considered and the files will be created.

```
prod3v3loper:netbeans tarim$ cd /Users/username/Sites/netbeans/your-project-folder
prod3v3loper:your-project-folder tarim$ php /Users/username/Projects/externTools/php-templates/php-scaffold-template/index.php
